    <h2>History</h2>
        <h4>At some point before becoming Arrancars, their original Hollow tried to live with its kind, only for them to lose their souls and die from simply being near its presence. Because of this, it became jealous of how the weak are allowed to come together, and so wanted to become weak. In an attempt to escape its loneliness, the original Hollow split its soul into two Arrancar, which became Coyote Starrk and Lilynette Gingerbuck respectively. Not remembering which of them were originally before they split, Starrk speculated their original appearance corresponded to neither of them. Even so, Starrk remarked that they wanted to become weak so they could be together with a group, and if this were not possible, they wanted to find someone as strong as them.[16]
        <p>When they split their soul, Starrk and his newly formed other half each asked each other if they had a name and told each other their names, despite them being the same person. Starrk threw Lilynette a cloth to wrap herself up in. As she asked him what they would do now, he stated they could do anything. When she asked where they would go, he, stating they could go anywhere, assured Lilynette no matter what, they would stick together forever.[17]
        <p>Starrk and Lilynette were alone when they were first found by Sousuke Aizen. The two were sitting in front of mountains of dead Hollows, which impressed Aizen. When asked if they had killed all the Hollows in the area, Starrk told him no, for they had just died. This further impressed Aizen, who told Starrk he seemed strong. Pondering something, Aizen told the Arrancar he was searching for allies. Commenting on what a coincidence it was, for they too were looking for allies, Starrk asked Aizen if his allies were strong. When Aizen told him to come along and find out for himself, Starrk, agreeing to join him, noted Aizen looked like he could stay with them without dying.[18]S

        <h2>Background</h2>
           <h4>From an early age, animals have naturally been drawn towards him. He was well-liked by any animal he encountered and they would act friendlier towards him than most other people. When he was a kid, he was offered a ride by a dog in his local area even though the dog had never once given a ride to anyone. During his time in elementary school, he was never once pecked by the chickens who were notoriously known by his classmates to peck. As Naofumi grew up, he worked multiple jobs at once, including at an izakaya and food-court.[1] Naofumi also stated the reason he stopped drinking alcohol was because he never got drunk, and seeing his friends getting drunk made him feel left out.
              <p>At the age of twenty, he was a sophomore in college and had a passion for video games, light novels, anime, and other otaku-like activities. He would often put his hobbies in front of his actual studies, which caused his parents to believe he was a lost cause and focused all their attention on his younger brother. This lead to them sending the younger brother to a famous prep-school in the hope to secure his future. However, their parents' intense pressure on his success led to them having a lack of freedom and free time. This ended up being too much stress for Naofumi's younger brother.</p>
            <p>This eventually led to Naofumi's brother becoming jealous of Naofumi's own freedom. He eventually becomes a troublemaker from the stress caused from his excessive studying. Naofumi's younger brother started dying his hair and swearing around the house. Naofumi himself was aware of the fact that the reason behind this change in his troublemaker was due to his stress. Eventually Naofumi took it upon himself to help his younger repair their relationship with the rest of the family. He did this by introduce him to a dating simulator game which his brother was initially hesitant playing at first. Eventually his brother got hooked into the game and Naofumi helped introduce him further into otaku culture. This helped reduce his younger brothers stress and began to rededicate himself to their studies.</p>
            <p>Naofumi's help eventually allowed his brother to become the top of its class and make it into a prestigious high school. This helped the family become more cohesive with less tension between the younger child their parents. This course of events eventually left Naofumi to have a budget and didn't need to work as he was in collage. This allowed him to further indulge his Otaku tendencies and do what he wanted. One day, Naofumi went to the library to read some books as he had used his monthly budget. In this library he found a book called The Record of the Four Holy Weapons. When he started reading it he found a blank page where the shield hero was supposed to be. He immediately lost consciousness when reading that book and found himself summoned in another world.</p>
